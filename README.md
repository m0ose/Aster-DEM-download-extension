# Aster-DEM-download-extension for Chrome


This is a workaround to get all of the ASTER digital elevation tiles from the [http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/](Earth Eplorer) web portal. Why they dont just give us an ftp or torrent file is beyond me.

It is against the terms of service for me to make a torrent for all of these, but I think that this extension is ok. 

# How to use
* Download this extension. unzip or whatever. 
* Enable developer mode in [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and then load the unpacked extension. 
* Get a login from earth explorer. This takes a little while. Beyond the scope of the readme. 
* Login, and click start on the extension popup. Keep the popup open.

# Todo
* Make this run in the background
* Warn when the user is not logged in.
